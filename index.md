I am an undergrad at [International Institute of Information Technology](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). Most of my work right now is in Information Theory and Coding Theory, but my interests include anything that has an algorithmic, algebraic or combinatoric flavour. 

Recently, most of my free time has gone into thinking about algebraic structures that make classical algorithms work. The intent of this blog is to document ideas for future, because I keep forgetting them.
